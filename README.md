The v07_ref folder contains more or less "canonical" code that is representative of the workflow for the first project paper submitted for publication. It has evolved over the course of the project. However, each the main script runs on an image set, it saves a copy of itself, its configuration file, logs, Fiji/ImageJ version and extension details, and other parameter information. 

Therefore, for any given data in the project output, it is possible to trace the full process up to the point of insertion into the SQLite database. These per-run archives are available upon request and may be compiled and uploaded at some point if that would be found helpful.
